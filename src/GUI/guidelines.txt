This document will serve as a guide for documenting the SSGUI Code as effectively and as clearly as possible.

1. You don't need to document the contructor and destructors. It is unnessecary. Document the class overall and its unique functions and members.

2. Class Documentation will be in Qt-style commments above the constructor.
//!  Simple class description.
/*!
  A more elaborate class description.
 *  \author    Jan Doe
 *  \date      1990-2011
 *  \pre       First initialize the system.
 *  \bug       Not all memory is freed when deleting an object of this class.
 *  \warning   Improper use can crash your application
 *  \copyright GNU Public License v3.
*/

Add references and external features as needed.

3. Member Documentation will be in Qt-style comments above their first usage. Keep as short as you can.
    //! A public variable.
    /*!
      Details (try and avoid these for basic variables).
    */

4. Document in the source (*.cpp) files. This is where anyone trying to modify the code will be looking at the most. Keep them clean and concise, without punctuation or grammatical errors.

5. Documents bugs with \bug in comments. These need to be outlined specifically.

6. Public Trello board?

7. Have dedicated pages stored in docs folder as Markdown files.
Subjects include:
 - Embedding simulation
 - Reading Joystick input
 - Lessons Learned
 - Smoke Simulation
 - Fluid Simulation
 - ML App

8. Style Docs to fit the aesthetic of the application (i.e. ORNL Logo, Summit Particles)

9. Publish Documents on GitHub/GitLab pages? (Ask Brian if ORNL could host it.) [Refer to TinyTitan docs]

10. Includes in all files (*.h or *.cpp) should be ordered like this:
local files, Qt files, other standard libraries.
