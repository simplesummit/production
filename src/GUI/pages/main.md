## What is Leconte?

![Test](../../src/GUI/assets/img/splash.png)

 Leconte is a computer system made to be utilized by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for outreach. Currently, it consists of one NVIDIA Jetson TX2 circuit boards, but is planned to be expanded to a cluster of 8 Jetsons, the purpose of which is to demonstrate the powers and advantages of parallel computing. This serves as a simplified version of supercomputers at ORNL such as Summit or Frontier. 

## What is an NVIDIA Jetson?

An NVIDIA Jetson TX2 is an embedded board made by NVIDIA that is built for robots and other maker projects. It is unique among other embedded boards in that it has 256 CUDA cores that make up its GPU. This allows it to run GPU-intensive tasks like machine learning or physics simulations much faster than a Raspberry Pi. 

The Jetson runs a custom version of Ubuntu and has ARM-64 architecture. 

This was the board of choice because it was the best evolution of the project, demonstrating the power of both distributed computing and GPUs. 

## Who made this?

 This app was developed by Tyler Duckworth and Logan O'Neal. Tyler worked primarily on the frontend of the application, designing and coding the GUI with Qt, an open-source C++ library. Logan worked on the three simulations that power this application: A smoke simulation, a fluid simulation, and a machine learning drawing demo. 
 
 This app was published under the GNU Public License v3 and is available on GitHub. Scripts have been provided to properly configure the environment for this app.
