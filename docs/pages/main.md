## What is this?

![Test](../../assets/img/splash.png)

 This app is a user interface made to be utilized by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for outreach. It is planned to run on an cluster of 8 NVIDIA Jetson TX2 circuit boards, the purpose of which is to demonstrate the powers and advantages of parallel computing. This serves as a simplified version of supercomputers at ORNL such as Summit or Frontier. 


## Who made this?

 This app was developed by Tyler Duckworth and Logan O'Neal. Tyler worked primarily on the frontend of the application, designing and coding the GUI with Qt, an open-source C++ library. Logan worked on the three simulations that power this application: A smoke simulation, a fluid simulation, and a machine learning drawing demo. 
 
 This app was published under the GNU Public License v3 and is available on GitHub. Scripts have been provided to properly configure the environment for this app.
